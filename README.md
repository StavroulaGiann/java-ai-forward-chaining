# Java AI – Search & Forward Chaining

Java project implementing fundamental Artificial Intelligence concepts,
including state-space representation and forward chaining inference.

## Part A – State Space Representation
- Definition of states and transitions
- Search logic using state representation
- Object-oriented design

## Part B – Forward Chaining
- Forward chaining for propositional logic
- Forward chaining for first-order logic (FOL)
- Rule-based inference mechanism

## Technologies
- Java
- Artificial Intelligence (Search & Inference)
- Object-Oriented Programming

## How to Run
Compile and run the Java files using any Java-compatible IDE
or from the command line.

## Notes
This project focuses on implementing core AI algorithms
and logical reasoning techniques.
